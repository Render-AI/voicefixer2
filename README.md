Welcome to VoiceFixer 2, the next generation of VoiceFixer. VoiceFixer is a general speech restoration tool, using AI to remove background noise, fix degraded speech, enhance audio quality from old recordings, upscale audio resolution, and more, all in one model!

VoiceFixer aims to restore human speech, regardless of how seriously degraded it is. It can handle noise, reverberation, low resolution, and clipping effect within one model!

## What's different from the original VoiceFixer?

The [original version of VoiceFixer](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer) continues to be updated with minor changes and bug fixes, however if one tries to install it and run it out of the box, one would encounter several errors that require modifying installed packages to fix.

**What’s the problem? How does this fix it?** VoiceFixer requires an old version of the `librosa` library, which is incompatible with new versions of the `numpy` library. We’ve fixed this issue by fixing the old version of `librosa` and `voicefixer`. We also added several new features.

### New features in VoiceFixer 2

We’ve added the following features in VoiceFixer 2:

* We’ve added MPS support, which means you can use GPU acceleration on M1 macs. You can enable this by setting the `cuda` parameter to `True`. It’s automatically enabled when using the command line interface (CLI).
* We've added a progress bar through TQDM for longer audio
* We now support non-WAV files (ie MP3)
* We're now using `cached_path` instead of hard-coding a cache path to increase OS support
* We're featuring faster model downloads w/ Hugging Face
* More features coming soon!

## Changelog

* Nov 16, 2023: Upgrade librosa + torch
* Nov 11, 2023: Publish to PyPI
* Nov 11, 2023: Add progress bar support (requires `ffmpeg`) (see TODO below)
* Nov 11, 2023: Add preliminary MP3 support (requires `ffmpeg`) (see TODO below)
* Nov 11, 2023: Fix CLI issue (see TODO below)
* Sep 14, 2023: Switch to NOSCL-C-2.0 license
* Sep 11, 2023: Forked from VoiceFixer

## To-Do

Here's what we still need to do - feel free to contribute:

- [ ] Fine-tune model for better results (this one requires $$$/compute :) - see [this](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer_main) training repo)
- [x] Use latest version of librosa (probably pretty important, here's the issue the model doesn't work with latest torchlibrosa and the old torchlibrosa doesn't work with the latest librosa. need to completely retrain the model probably or change model python file) - fixed thanks to @manmay-nakhashi
- [ ] Add MP3 support for folders
- [ ] Allow user to restore an object (don't require a file)
- [ ] Update model to make [modifying state dict](https://github.com/voicefixer/voicefixer/commit/1b8c384bc2f34645e72c67e46db92b3accd20613) unnecessary - loading it twice increases VRAM usage
- [ ] [Realtime support](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer_main/issues/11)
- [ ] Support Windows (mostly file paths) - maybe use [cached_path](https://github.com/allenai/cached_path)
- [x] Switch models from Zenodo to Hugging Face to increase speed and control over models (in progress)
- [x] Publish to pip (plz don't contribute on this one - I'll do it eventually but I have a certain workflow + system I like to use :) thanks!)
- [x] Add TQDM progress bar - crucial for longer conversions - maybe a beginner contribution?
- [x] Implement .mp3 support (currently only supports .wav) - probably won't be that hard - just need to use pydub. good beginner contribution!
- [x] Fix CLI instead of copying to /bin use CLI like [this](https://github.com/fakerybakery/simplesplit/blob/main/setup.py)

## Demo

[Check out the demos to see what VoiceFixer can do!](https://haoheliu.github.io/demopage-voicefixer/)

## Installation

**NOTE: If you have any issues on Apple Silicon, please install PyTorch Nightly (`pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu`)**

You can install our package via. PyPI (Python Package Index), the official Python package index.

```
pip install voicefixer2
```

This will install the latest published release.

**If you would like to install the latest development version, or do not trust PyPI for any reason, please install directly from the source:**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fakerybakery/voicefixer
```

### Including in Requirements

You may include voicefixer2 in your requirements.txt file:

```
voicefixer2
```

or

```
git+https://github.com/voicefixer/voicefixer
```

or, in setup.py

```python
[
    'voicefixer2 @ git+https://github.com/voicefixer/voicefixer',
]
```

or simply

```python
[
    'voicefixer2',
]
```

### FFmpeg

**NOTE:** For MP3/OGG/etc (non-WAV) support, you must install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

**Quick Installation**

* macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
* Linux/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
* Windows: `scoop install main/ffmpeg`

This is not guaranteed to work on all devices. Please see [FFmpeg's website](https://ffmpeg.org/) for instructions to install manually.

## Usage

**Important:** FFmpeg must be installed to support non-.wav files.

### Command Line

By default, if no output path is specified, the file will be saved to `outfile.wav`.

Process a file:

```bash
voicefixer --infile test/utterance/original/original.wav
```

Process all files in a directory:

```bash
voicefixer --infolder /path/to/input --outfolder /path/to/output
```

Change modes (default 0):

```bash
voicefixer --infile /path/to/input.wav --outfile /path/to/output.wav --mode 1
```

Run all modes:

```bash
voicefixer --infile /path/to/input.wav --outfile /path/to/output.wav --mode all
```

For more information:

```bash
voicefixer -h
```

### Python API

```python
from voicefixer import VoiceFixer
voicefixer = VoiceFixer()
# Mode 0: Original Model (suggested by default)
# Mode 1: Add preprocessing module (remove higher frequency)
# Mode 2: Train mode (might work sometimes on seriously degraded real speech)
for mode in [0,1,2]:
    print("Testing mode",mode)
    voicefixer.restore(input=os.path.join(git_root,"test/utterance/original/original.flac"), # low quality .wav/.flac file
                       output=os.path.join(git_root,"test/utterance/output/output_mode_"+str(mode)+".flac"), # save file path
                       cuda=False, # GPU acceleration
                       mode=mode)
    if(mode != 2):
        check("output_mode_"+str(mode)+".flac")
    print("Pass")
```
